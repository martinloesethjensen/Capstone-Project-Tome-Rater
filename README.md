# Capstone-Project-Tome-Rater
Capstone Project in Codecademy intensive course: **Programming with Python** (_Jun 12, 2018 - Aug 28, 2018_)
#

In this project we were tasked with building a new application for literature review. 
We had to make use of what we have learned through all of the course. 
Such as:
- _Data types_
- _Architecture_
- _Classes_ 
- _Inheritance_
- _Control flow_

The instructions to the project can be found in the pdf: **_TomeRater Instructions.pdf_**

### Extra info
I wanted to separate all of the existing classes; `User`, `Book`, `Fiction`, `NonFiction` and `TomeRater`.
So it wouldn't be in a standalone file as it is now.

I would have made use of the _Single Responsibility design pattern_, where a class only does logic to that class and that behaviour. 
Right now the **TomeRater** file is long and I would have made a new file for each class. It would also give the classes better readability.
